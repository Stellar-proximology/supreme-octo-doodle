# Cynthia Prime

Mobile-first, offline-capable PWA with avatar (TTS + mic), prompt library, local-first storage, and LLM routing (Ollama with cloud fallback). Runs on desktop or Termux with one command.

## Why Node/Express + better-sqlite3?
- Termux-friendly (no Python build chain pain, no Prisma engine downloads).
- Single binary SQLite via `better-sqlite3` = fast and reliable.
- TS end-to-end, minimal dependencies, PWA-first.

> Note: A Prisma schema is included for future migrations, but runtime uses `better-sqlite3` for Termux stability.
